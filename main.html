	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the size of its input (denoted as n). For the code to be efficient it should be optimised before running.</p1>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution, including input storage and additional temporary variables. An algorithm with O(n) space complexity requires memory that grows linearly with the input size, making it efficient for handling large datasets while keeping memory usage manageable</p2>
